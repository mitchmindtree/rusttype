//! RustType is a pure Rust alternative to libraries like FreeType.
//!
//! The current capabilities of RustType:
//!
//! * Reading TrueType formatted fonts and font collections. This includes `*.ttf` as well as a subset
//!   of `*.otf` font files.
//! * Retrieving glyph shapes and commonly used properties for a font and its glyphs.
//! * Laying out glyphs horizontally using horizontal and vertical metrics, and glyph-pair-specific kerning.
//! * Rasterising glyphs with sub-pixel positioning using an accurate analytical algorithm
//!   (not based on sampling).
//! * Managing a font cache on the GPU with the `gpu_cache` module. This keeps recently used glyph renderings
//!   in a dynamic cache in GPU memory to minimise texture uploads per-frame. It also allows you keep the draw
//!   call count for text very low, as all glyphs are kept in one GPU texture.
//!
//! Notable things that RustType does not support *yet*:
//!
//! * OpenType formatted fonts that are not just TrueType fonts (OpenType is a superset of TrueType). Notably
//!   there is no support yet for cubic Bezier curves used in glyphs.
//! * Font hinting.
//! * Ligatures of any kind.
//! * Some less common TrueType sub-formats.
//! * Right-to-left and vertical text layout.
//!
//! # Getting Started
//!
//! Add the following to your Cargo.toml:
//!
//! ```toml
//! [dependencies]
//! rusttype = "0.2.0"
//! ```
//!
//! To hit the ground running with RustType, look at the `simple.rs` example supplied with the crate. It
//! demonstrates loading a font file, rasterising an arbitrary string, and displaying the result as ASCII art.
//! If you prefer to just look at the documentation, the entry point for loading fonts is `FontCollection`,
//! from which you can access individual fonts, then their glyphs.
//!
//! # Glyphs
//!
//! The glyph API uses wrapper structs to augment a glyph with
//! information such as scaling and positioning, making relevant methods that make use of this information
//! available as appropriate. For example, given a `Glyph` `glyph` obtained directly from a `Font`:
//!
//! ```no_run
//! # use rusttype::*;
//! # let glyph: Glyph<'static> = unimplemented!();
//! // One of the few things you can do with an unsized, positionless glyph is get its id.
//! let id = glyph.id();
//! let glyph = glyph.scaled(Scale::uniform(10.0));
//! // Now glyph is a ScaledGlyph, you can do more with it, as well as what you can do with Glyph.
//! // For example, you can access the correctly scaled horizontal metrics for the glyph.
//! let h_metrics = glyph.h_metrics();
//! let glyph = glyph.positioned(point(5.0, 3.0));
//! // Now glyph is a PositionedGlyph, and you can do even more with it, e.g. drawing.
//! glyph.draw(|x, y, v| {}); // In this case the pixel values are not used.
//! ```
//!
//! # Unicode terminology
//!
//! This crate uses terminology for computerised typography as specified by the Unicode standard. If you are
//! not sure of the differences between a code point, a character, and a glyph, you may want to check the
//! [official Unicode glossary](http://unicode.org/glossary/), or alternatively, here's my take on it from a
//! practical perspective:
//!
//! * A character is what you would conventionally call a single symbol, independent of its appearance or
//!   representation in a particular font. Examples include `a`, `A`, `ä`, `å`, `1`, `*`, `Ω`, etc.
//! * A Unicode code point is the particular number that the Unicode standard associates with a particular
//!   character.
//!   Note however that code points also exist for things not conventionally thought of as characters by
//!   themselves, but can be combined to form characters, such as diacritics like accents. These
//!   "characters" are known in Unicode as "combining characters".
//!   E.g., a diaeresis (`¨`) has the code point U+0308. If this code point follows the code point U+0055
//!   (the letter `u`), this sequence represents the character `ü`. Note that there is also a
//!   single codepoint for `ü`, U+00FC. This means that what visually looks like the same string can have
//!   multiple different Unicode representations. Some fonts will have glyphs (see below) for one sequence of
//!   codepoints, but not another that has the same meaning. To deal with this problem it is recommended to use
//!   Unicode normalisation, as provided by, for example, the
//!   [unicode-normalization](http://crates.io/crates/unicode-normalization) crate, to convert to code point
//!   sequences that work with the font in question. Typically a font is more likely to support a single code
//!   point vs. a sequence with the same meaning, so the best normalisation to use is "canonical recomposition",
//!   known as NFC in the normalisation crate.
//! * A glyph is a particular font's shape to draw the character for a particular Unicode code point. This will
//!   have its own identifying number unique to the font, its ID.
